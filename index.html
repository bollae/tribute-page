<div class"col-xs-8"><p><i>“When I left Tibet and settled in the West, I realised that the Dzogchen Teaching was a vast body of knowledge that could help us live our condition, as human beings, better, beyond any cultural context, allowing for a “natural” spiritual and social evolution.”</i></p>
  <p>Today, Master Chogyal Namkhai Norbu is the supreme present-day representative of the tradition of the Dzogchen (Great Perfection) Teachings, an ancient teaching which can help to direct people towards a natural condition of non-violence, compassion and kindness.</p>
<p>The message delivered by the Master for 50 years is that it is possible to live harmoniously, even in the midst of chaotic, modern daily life and lead a lifestyle that is relaxed, collaborative and peaceful.</p>
<p>Born and raised in Tibet, Chogyal Namkhai Norbu was invited to Italy in the 1960’s where he worked on a research project and subsequently held an academic post, teaching Tibetan Language and Literature at the Istituto Universitario Orientale in Naples.</p>
<p>His academic committments and the circulation of his ideas had a considerable international resonance and several institutes have been created, dedicated to the study and diffusion of Tibetan culture, such as the Shang Shung International Institute for Tibetan Studies, and the non profit-making NGO, ASIA, which develops projects benefiting the Tibetan population.</p>
<p>Following his academic activities at University, Chogyal Namkhai Norbu was contacted by a variety of people; students, intellectuals and professionals, not only Italian but also from different Western countries, interested to know about the Dzogchen Teaching. This ancient discipline, which answers the profound need for a joyful and serene life, although virtually unknown to the general public, began to stimulate curiosity and interest.</p>
<p>Chogyal Namkhai Norbu honoured this request for the Teaching in the 1970’s, holding the first courses and lectures on Dzogchen meditation, and the traditional Tibetan discipline of Yantra Yoga.</p>
<p>The figure and the teaching of Chogyal Namkhai Norbu inspired the formation of the International Dzogchen Community, of which the European headquarters, Merigar, was founded in 1981 in Italy.</p>
<p>Today, the International Dzogchen Community has headquarters in different countries around the world. The Master travels and teaches Dzogchen tirelessly to those who request it, continuing his activity of divulging this precious message of humanity and evolution.</p></div>
